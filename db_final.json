On-page refers to both the content and HTML source code of a page that can be optimized, as opposed to off-page SEO which refers to links and other external signals\".\r\n\r\n## 1. Structure of URL ##\r\n\r\n - Study on seo tell us that **urls should be short,** concise, and easily readable\r\n\r\n - Each word in your URL should be separated by a hyphen (-) and not an underscore (_)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Eg.  http://globalforumonline.com/on-page-seo/detail/\r\n\r\n -  Never use capital words inside urls\r\n\r\n - Url should be contain your  main keyword in which you want to rank it.\r\nAnd try to keep it forward in url string\r\n\r\n\r\n    Eg.  http://globalforumonline.com/on-page-seo/\r\n\r\nabove url contains my topic keyword **on page seo** \r\n\r\n - Try to keep short string url because it perform better than Long string urls. You should make it **3 \u2013 5 words** .\r\n\r\n Eg.  **Yoursite.com/keywords**   perform more better than \r\n **yoursite.com/123/754/der\r\nftg /keywords**\r\n\r\n - If it is possible don\u2019t change your url. Make it evergreen. because update in url may create dead links in those  pages which is connected  to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n![various methods of on page seo][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n## 2.

So make sure you have title tags on your page \r\n\r\n - Best title length  is  ** upto 60 characters** .Keep your main keyword inside the title and try to keep it forward  if it is possible. \r\n\r\n - Create unique titles for each page so that search engine can understand that all pages are unique.\r\n \r\n - Use brief, but descriptive titles. Titles can be both short and informative. If the title is too long or otherwise deemed less relevant, Google may show only a portion of it or one that's automatically generated in the search result\r\n\r\n - Use keyword  like \u201cbest\u201d, \u201cguide\u201d,  \u201clatest\u201d and \u201cadvance\u201d can help you rank for long tail versions of your target keyword\r\n\r\n - Avoid repetition of keyword inside your title\r\n\r\n - You can use **Moz\u2019s preview tool**  to preview how your title tags will appear in the search engine.\r\n\r\n - If you have a famous brand name then you can take advantage of it.  Place your brand name at  the starting of the title otherwise keep it at last.\r\n\r\n - Use numbers and years inside title eg.  **\u201c10 things you should never forget for better life\u201d**\r\nto make it  more effective and attractive.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 3. Meta  description ##\r\n\r\n>  **SurveyMonkey** have found that **43.2%** of people click on a given\r\n> *result due to the meta description*\r\n    \r\n - It's important that meta descriptions on each page be unique\r\n\r\n - Optimum length of meta description is **50-300 characters**.

Heading ##\r\n\r\n - Use  **h1 tag** for  main heading and  keep your keyword inside heading\r\n\r\n - You should never have more than one h1 tag on any page\r\n\r\n - For **subheading use h2 and h3** tag according to your need \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 8.

To avoid this, try to keep your keyword density to **roughly 2-3%**.\r\n\r\n - Avoid writing sloppy text with many spelling and grammatical mistake\r\n\r\n - Avoid dumping large amounts of text on varying topics onto a page without paragraph, subheading, or layout separation\r\n\r\n - Optimize content for your users, not search engines. Try to avoid  unnecessary **keywords stuffing**\r\n\r\n - *Use images and video relevant to your content for better user experience.*\r\n\r\n - Length of content is  a  topic of discussion but generally seen that Longer content seems to be preferred by  2011 Google algorithm update but it can\u2019t be a rule for each and every website. Optimum **content  length about 2000 or more**.\r\n\r\n![graph between length of content  and their position ][6]\r\n\r\n\r\n - Write 3-5  sentence in one paragraph and use <p> tag for this.\r\n\r\n> *Regularly update  your content. Google takes freshness very seriously.*\r\n> *Back in **April 2012**, freshness was one of the algorithm ranking factors*\r\n> *that **affected 35% of search querie**s.*\r\n\r\n - Use  tools like Google **AdWords Keyword Planner**  to see search volume, or analyze what your competitors are targeting with **SEMRush**  .\r\n\r\n - Use keywords that are  synonyms  of your targeted keyword.

Imagine that you're writing anchor text for a text link\r\n \r\n - Use commonly supported file types . Most browsers support JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP and WebP image formats. It's also a good idea to have the extension of your filename match with the file type\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![weightage of different factors in advance seo ][7]\r\n\r\n\r\n## 10.

Generally **use 4-5 internal links**.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 13. robot.txt ##\r\n\r\n\r\n- A **\"robots.txt\"** file tells search engines whether they can access and therefore **crawl** parts of your site. This file, which must be named \"robots.txt\", is placed in the root directory of your site.\r\n\r\n- If certain page of your site is not useful for users then you can block it by using robot.txt .\r\n\r\n**Basic format of robot.txt file**-\r\n\r\n    User-agent: [user-agent name] \r\n    \r\n    Disallow: [URL string not to be crawled]\r\n\r\nFor Eg.\r\n\r\n **Blocking specific url** \r\n \r\n\r\n    User-agent: Googlebot\r\n\r\n    Disallow: /example-subfolder/blocked-page.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Some other factor you should consider ##\r\n\r\n\r\n - Use **social sharing button**s it will increase  social sharing\r\n\r\n -  Make user friendly page layout \r\n\r\n - Fix any **crawl errors**\r\n\r\n - Sniff out unnecessary code\r\n\r\n - Use **minify** form of html , js and css to improve site speed\r\n\r\n - Fix your broken links\r\n\r\n - Use **canonical tag** for duplicate content in your site.\r\n\r\n - Use **404 error** page for any dead link\r\n\r\n \r\n![this images is about advance technique of SEO][8]\r\n\r\n\r\n## Conclusion##\r\n\r\n\r\n> Google algorithms are changing day by day.

Search engine respond to a certain question that the user has posted is called  **keyword**. When we type a query in search engine then it breaks into small segments.shown in below image..\r\n\r\n![How does search engine works][1]\r\n\r\nIt actually search the relevant information related to that particular keyword from web ocean and displays that information. Display of information that you see in the search engine is called as a SERP search engine results page .This is basically how the search engines work. \r\n\r\nNow let's understand  into what actually goes behind it and what are the steps and key factors that it is using for search and display the results.\r\n\r\n**Actually search engine works into three basic steps.** \r\n\r\n## Crawling (discover content) ##\r\n\r\nBefore understanding crawling process first we understand what is crawler or spider.\r\n\r\n> *A spider, also known as a robot or a crawler, is actually just a*\r\n> *program that follows, or \"crawls\", links throughout the Internet.*\r\n> *Search engine uses web crawlers to discover publicly available web*\r\n> *pages in the web (www).*\r\n\r\n*In simple words we can understand crawling as a process to discover all contents available on web by following the links available on web pages.*\r\n\r\n![crawling by robot of search engine][2]\r\n\r\nSpiders only can reach from one site to other site and one page to other page through the links. That\u2019s why links to your site (**inbound links**) are so important.\r\n\r\nLinks to your website from other websites will give the search engine spiders more \"food\" to chew on.\r\n\r\nThe crawling process begins with a list of web addresses from past crawls and **sitemaps** provided by website owners. As crawlers visit these websites, they use links on those sites to discover other pages. \r\n\r\n## Indexing (analysis and stored ) ##\r\n\r\nThe first thing to understand is that when we do a search we are not actually searching the web, we are searching  index of the web.\r\n\r\nSo Before you search, spider gather information from across hundreds of billions of web pages by crawling and organize it in the Search index.\r\n\r\n![indexing process by search engine][3]\r\n\r\n> *when  web crawler find a web page it render all content of web page*\r\n> *just like a web browser. After rendering a page it collect all data*\r\n> *related to that page like available  keywords, website freshness,*\r\n> *domain related information etc and make index of it and stored back*\r\n> *into database.*\r\n\r\nWhen  web crawler find a web page it render all content of web page just like a web browser. After rendering a page it collect all data related to that page like available  keywords, website freshness, domain related information etc and make index of it and stored back into database.\r\n\r\nIt just similar like making a list of all the books you own, their publishers, their authors, their genres, their page counts, etc.\r\n\r\nThe [Google Search index][4]  contains hundreds of billions of **web pages** and is well over **100,000,000 gigabytes** in size. It\u2019s just like the index in the back of a book \u2014 with an entry for every word seen on every web page are indexed.\r\n\r\nSo at last we can understand indexing as process to analysis a webpage and stored it into database for further use.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Retrieval ( fetched and display ) ##\r\n\r\nThird step is, fetching data from the search index and deliver it to user in an order. For which different algorithm are used.\r\n\r\n**PageRank** ( made by google)  is the best known algorithm which is used to improve web search results. PageRank was named after **Larry Page**, one of the founders of Google. PageRank is a way of measuring the importance of website pages.\r\n\r\n**\"This is  section where SEO comes into picture.\"**\r\n\r\nAccording to [Google][5]  \r\n\r\n> **PageRank** works by counting the number and quality of links to a page\r\n> *to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The*\r\n> *underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to*\r\n> *receive more links from other websites.*\r\n\r\n![Retrieval ( fetched and display )][6]\r\n\r\nSearch engines also pay attention to lots of other \u2018signals\u2019 when working out the order to show results. For example how often the page is updated and if it is from a trustworthy domain, how\r\nmany times does this page contain searched keywords, do the words appear in the title and the URL directly adjacent does the page include synonyms for those words, is this page from a quality website or is it low quality even spammy.\r\n\r\nGoogle consider more than [200 factors][7] during retrieval process.Finally combining all these factors search engine give rank to web pages and show it to user within less than a seconds.\r\n\r\n> *[Google][8] covers more than **90%** of Search Engine Market Share Worldwide*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Following are the several search engines available today: ##\r\n\r\n\r\n| Search Engine                    |                                               About                                                        |\r\n|:-------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|Google                                  |   It was originally called **BackRub**.

Red light can pass through the atmosphere and not get scattered much, while light at the blue end of the spectrum is more easily scattered. When you see a red moon, you\u2019re seeing the red light that wasn\u2019t scattered, but the blue and green light have been scattered away. That\u2019s why the [Moon looks red][4]\r\n\r\nIt will be complete lunar eclipse. This lunar eclipse is also very special because in the same year it will be the second blood moon lunar eclipse.\r\n\r\n## Astrologers are assuming influential and rare ##\r\n\r\nMars will be very close to Earth during the lunar eclipse due to this reason astrologers are assuming  very strong and influential.

Therefore it is auspicious to donate\r\n> charity even after eclipse.\r\n\r\n## Some special fact about moon ##\r\n\r\n![lunar eclipse][5]\r\n\r\n - The Moon (or Luna) is the Earth\u2019s only natural satellite and was formed 4.6 billion years ago around some 30\u201350 million years after the formation of the solar system.\r\n\r\n - The Moon is the fifth largest natural satellite in the Solar System.\r\n\r\n - The Moon is moving approximately 3.8 cm away from our planet every\r\n year.\r\n\r\n - The average distance from the Moon to the Earth is **384403 kilometres** (238857 miles).\r\n\r\n - The Moon rotates on its axis in around the same length of time it takes to orbit the Earth. This means that from Earth we only ever see around 60% of its surface (50% at any one time).\r\n\r\n - The Moon is very hot during the day but very cold at night. The average surface temperature of the Moon is **107 degrees Celsius** during the day and **-153 degrees Celsius** at night.\r\n\r\n - The rise and fall of the tides on Earth is caused by the Moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_eclipse\r\n  [2]: https://globalforumonline.com/media/special/blood-moon-lunar-eclipse.jpg\r\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering\r\n  [4]: https://www.universetoday.com/19969/red-moon/\r\n  [5]: https://globalforumonline.com/media/special/sun_and_earth_lunar_eclipse.jpg", "height_field": 747, "width_field": 1221, "draft": false, "viewed": 2523, "publish": "2018-07-26", "updated": "2019-08-09T18:47:56.298Z", "timestamp": "2018-07-26T15:09:58.588Z"}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 7, "fields": {"category": 7, "user": 1, "title": "All about Steel Companies in India", "description": "This post is all about steel companies in india,  their problems and  Why domestic Steel Companies are not able to compete to foreign companies...", "keywords": "Steel companies in india, domestic Steel Companies , Status of supply and demand of steel globally, Demand of seel,", "slug": "all-about-steel-companies-in-india", "image": "blog_pic/12/steel.jpg", "image_description": "Steel", "video": "", "content": "Importance of steel can be understood from following data (in FY 2017-18) relating to eight core sector in India.\r\n\r\n\r\n| Sector              |   Weight   |\r\n|:--------------|:--------|\r\n| Coal              | 10.3   |\r\n| crude oil         | 9.0    |\r\n| Natural gas       | 6.9    |\r\n| Refienary product | 28.0   |\r\n| Fertilizer        | 2.6    |\r\n| **Steel**             | **17.9**   |\r\n| Cement           | 5.4   |\r\n| Electricity       | 19.9   |\r\n\r\n\r\n**Source :-**  [Ministry of Commerce & Industry][1](Government of India)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo from above table we can expect that how steel is important for growth and development of any country.\r\n\r\n> India is [world 3rd largest ][2] producer of crude steel and largest\r\n> producer of direct reduced iron (DRI) or sponge. And also **3rd\r\n> largest consumer** of finished steel. Steel sector contribute 2% of\r\n> Indian`s GDP and 25 lakhs employed in steel/allied sector.\r\n\r\nIndia export stood at 7.6 million tons (52.9% more than the previous year)   whereas import stood at 6.09 million tons (10.9% more than previous year) i.e India is net exporter of total finished steel in FY 17-18.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Status of supply and demand of steel globally ##\r\n\r\nThere was a decline in global consumption of steel like in China, Japan, USA, Russia. But in India government`s policy are focusing on infrastructure development and construction sector so steel demand are still rising. But due to glut of steel from mainly China, korea and Japan, domestic companies are not compete to those .By which domestic company are facing stress and some CPSE are in loss making like SAIL.\r\n\r\n![ranking of top global steel producer][3]\r\n\r\nIndia is expected to become the second largest steel producer in the world by 2018, based on increased capacity addition in anticipation of upcoming demand, and the new steel policy, that has been approved by the Union Cabinet in May 2017, is expected to boost India's steel production.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why domestic Steel Companies are not able to compete to foreign companies ##\r\n\r\nThere are various reason, some important reason are following-\r\n\r\n - As the cost of total steel production depends on the iron ore and coke. But by the order of Supreme Court some of the ore mines were shut down like Goa iron ore mines. And also Karnataka mines and Odisha mines are facing stress, which causes scarcity in iron ore (Even though India is 4th largest iron ore reserve). And also the coke produced in India are metallurgical coke which is of poor quality and contain high ash content.\r\n\r\n - Though some Chinese companies are also facing the stress but to capture the Indian`s domestic market they are supplying at lower cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Government initiatives ##\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment has taken various measure to boost the steel consumption, some important steps are given below:-\r\n\r\n - Government of India is focusing on infrastructure development and restarting road project to aid the consumption of steel.\r\n> The Union Cabinet, Government of India has approved the National Steel\r\n> Policy (NSP) 2017, as it seeks to create a globally competitive steel\r\n> industry in India. NSP 2017 targets 300 million tons (MT) steel-making\r\n> capacity and 160 kg per capita steel consumption by 2030.\r\n\r\n - Metal Scrap Trade Corporation (MSTC) Limited and the Ministry of Steel have jointly launched an e-platform called 'MSTC Metal Mandi' under the 'Digital India' initiative, which will facilitate sale of finished and semi-finished steel products.\r\n\r\n - The Ministry of Steel is facilitating setting up of an industry driven Steel Research and Technology Mission of India (SRTMI) in association with the public and private sector steel companies to spearhead research and development activities in the iron and steel industry at an initial corpus of Rs.200 crore (US$ 30 million).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Way Forward ##\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n - R&D department of every steel industry should focus on cost competitiveness/quality improvement, which may be done through:-\r\n\r\n  - Development of innovative/ path breaking technologies for utilization of iron ore fines and non-coking coal.\r\n\r\n  - Benefits of raw materials like iron ore, coal etc. and agglomeration.\r\n\r\n  - Improvement in quality of steel produced through the induction furnace.\r\n\r\n![capacity of top steel companies in india][4]\r\n - Development and commercialization of new product.\r\n\r\n - On imposing Anti Dumping Duty on imported steel (but also have to care the WTO norms).\r\n\r\n - There needs to be an independent body rather than Government as a regulator for steel industry \r\n  where there are players from both private and public sector. Government should look at policy issues \r\n  while implementation and day to day issues should be looked up by an independent regulator \r\n  covering all the inputs and outputs of steel industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=179036\r\n  [2]: https://currentaffairs.gktoday.in/india-largest-producer-crude-steel-01201852095.html\r\n  [3]: https://globalforumonline.com/media/business/top_global_steel_producer.jpg\r\n  [4]: https://globalforumonline.com/media/business/steel_companies_in_india.jpg", "height_field": 450, "width_field": 900, "draft": false, "viewed": 825, "publish": "2018-07-27", "updated": "2019-08-09T18:47:55.325Z", "timestamp": "2018-07-27T11:24:20.335Z"}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 8, "fields": {"category": 6, "user": 2, "title": "Assam NRC List : 40 Lakh people risk to losing citizenship", "description": "A list of citizenship has been issued  in Assam ,40 Lakh people risk to losing citizenship Today I will going to discuss latest topic related to Assam NRC list,  what will be the next step with non citizens and why Govt are doing this\u2026.", "keywords": "Assam news, Assam latest news, assam NRC list, assam lates news, assam news 30 july,30 july assam lates news, NRC list of assam, latest news", "slug": "assam-nrc-list-40-lakh-people-risk-to-losing-citizenship", "image": "blog_pic/12/assam1.jpg", "image_description": "Assam state", "video": "", "content": "A list of citizenship has been issued in the Northeastern state of Assam, according to which **40 lakh** people settled in the state are not citizens.

These web pages are made available via world wide web (www).\r\n\r\n**\"Web hosts\"** are companies that rent their computers(servers) to store websites, and provide internet connectivity so that other computers can access files on your website.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of web hosting services ##\r\n\r\nIn present time there are many type of hosting services are famous. They are based on customer demands and traffic.\r\n\r\n## Shared Web Hosting ##\r\n\r\nIn share web hosting many websites share a single web server of host company. This type of web hosting service allows multiple websites to utilize storage, computing power, network and other resources of a single web server.You can understand share hosting just like renting a apartment in a building.\r\n\r\n![share hosting][1]\r\n*Pic credit-webhostingsecretrevealed.net*\r\n\r\n**Advantage of shared hosting**\r\n\r\n - Share hosting are cheapest plan and **less maintenance, less skill  requirement**.\r\n\r\n - Generally they have in built c panel like facilities that makes it more **reliable** for customers.\r\n\r\n**Disadvantage of shared hosting**\r\n\r\n - Disadvantage of share hosting is that if your site  begins to receive higher levels of traffic you\u2019ll begin to notice that your site might begin to perform much worse.\r\n\r\n - Site **loading speed** is also less as compared to dedicated host.\r\n\r\n - Less options are available for customization.\r\n\r\n\r\nShared web hosting is recommended for websites that are smaller in size, don\u2019t have a large amount of Web traffic and  having considerably lower security concerns.\r\n\r\n## Dedicated Web Hosting ##\r\n\r\nIn dedicated hosting a single server is given to a single website. This gives you much more control over its configuration and overall operating environment.Share hosting is similar to owing the entire building .\r\n\r\n![dedicated hosting][2]\r\n*Pic credit-webhostingsecretrevealed.net*\r\n\r\n**Advantage of dedicated hosting**\r\n\r\nAdvantages provided by a dedicated web hosting service includes high performance, security, email stability, and control. It gives you max  control ,security , flexibility and stability over your dedicated server. Dedicated hosting gives customers full root access.\r\n\r\n**Disadvantage of dedicated hosting**\r\n\r\nDedicated type of web hosting service  is more **expensive** than other hosting options and requires a certain level of technical knowledge.\r\n\r\n## Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosting ##\r\n\r\nVisualization technology is used in VPS hosting. Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosting is a device in which a server is split into many virtual servers, and each one websites has its own virtual server, but in fact all virtual servers share the same main server.\r\n\r\n![VPS hosting][3]\r\n*Pic credit-webhostingsecretrevealed.net*\r\n\r\n**Advantage of VPS hosting**\r\n\r\nThis type of web hosting service  gives you root access to your server, dedicated resources, more flexibility ,more customization and an isolated hosting environment, so there are no other sites sharing your resources.\r\n\r\n**Disadvantage of VPS hosting** \r\n\r\nThese web hosting is a bit costly and the websites with more visitor  used this hosting. If you want performance like dedicated server in less money then VPS is the best for you.\r\n\r\n## Reseller Web Hosting ##\r\n\r\n\r\n![reseller hosting][4]\r\n\r\nA lot of web hosting firms offer reseller hosting service. With reseller hosting, the account owner of reseller hosting service rents out portion of the disk space and bandwidth he receives to other end users. Therefore, the account owner is like a hosting service provider to those end users.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Cloud Web Hosting ##\r\n\r\nCloud hosting combines hundreds of individual servers together to function as one giant server.\r\nIn cloud hosting you can easily scale up and upgrade your server needs when necessary.\r\n\r\n![cloud hosting][5]\r\n*Pic credit-webhostingsecretrevealed.net*\r\n\r\n**Advantage of Cloud hosting**\r\n\r\n - Sudden increment in traffic can be easily handle by adding more server resources.\r\n\r\n - The pricing for cloud web hosting tends to vary as they normally use a form of a pay-for-what-you-use pricing structure.\r\n\r\n**Disadvantage of cloud hosting**\r\n\r\nDisadvantage of this types of web hosting services  is that  you have **not authority of root access**.\r\nAs compared to other it is  **costly**.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://globalforumonline.com/media/technology/shared-hosting.jpg\r\n  [2]: https://globalforumonline.com/media/technology/dedicated-hosting.jpg\r\n  [3]: https://globalforumonline.com/media/technology/vps-hosting.jpg\r\n  [4]: https://globalforumonline.com/media/technology/reseller_hosting.jpg\r\n  [5]: https://globalforumonline.com/media/technology/cloud-hosting.jpg", "height_field": 400, "width_field": 770, "draft": false, "viewed": 1045, "publish": "2018-08-05", "updated": "2019-08-09T18:47:54.992Z", "timestamp": "2018-08-06T07:46:42.807Z"}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 11, "fields": {"category": 6, "user": 2, "title": "World's first thermal battery plant in india", "description": "India have started  world\u2019s first  thermal battery  plant.

The electrolyte, which functions as a separator between the anode and the cathode, remains solid and non-conductive until activation. The battery remains completely inert while being stored. In each battery, the necessary number of cells is connected in series or parallel, or a combination of both, in order to produce the required voltage level(s).\r\n\r\n![how thermal battery works][1]\r\n#pic credit: The indian express\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment of activation the pyrotechnic material (heat source) is ignited and releases energy into the cells. The temperature increases, the electrolyte melts and ion exchange takes place: the power in the cell is thus liberated. The electrical current is transmitted through the terminals to external cabling to provide the energy required to the load.[more..][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n ## Benefits of this plant ##\r\n\r\n> BEST is coming up with a greenfield facility in Andhra Pradesh to\r\n> manufacture these batteries at an investment of Rs 660 crores. This\r\n> facility is expected to create 3,000 jobs in a span of three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n - These batteries are better than solar panels, which depend on weather conditions and are expensive to maintain. The batteries are expected to reduce the country\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels and other non-renewable sources of energy.\r\n\r\n - Initially, the facility is expected to operate at a capacity of 1,000 megawatts which will later be increased to 10 gigawatts by 2025.\r\n\r\n - This can be a milestone in the development of electric vehicles. \r\n\r\n> It will produce batteries for telecom, mini/microgrids, and electric\r\n> buses, that are expected to run for up to **800kms** on a single charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://globalforumonline.com/media/special/how_thermal_battery_works-GFO.jpg\r\n  [2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPKquDj3aAE&t=8s", "height_field": 400, "width_field": 700, "draft": false, "viewed": 1096, "publish": "2018-08-12", "updated": "2019-08-09T19:10:49.965Z", "timestamp": "2018-08-11T21:59:28.724Z"}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 13, "fields": {"category": 8, "user": 3, "title": "How Android was made (Android Architecture)", "description": "All about android all 5 stack Linux Kernal, Libraries, Application Framework, Applications, Android Runtime", "keywords": "Display Driver, Camera Driver, Flash Memory Driver, Binder(IPC) Driver,Keypad Driver, Wi-FI Driver ,Audio Driver,Power Management", "slug": "how-android-was-made-android-architecture", "image": "blog_pic/14/android.png", "image_description": "Android Architecture", "video": "", "content": "**Android is an open software plateform for mobile development. it is intended to be  a complete stack that includes everything from the operating system through middleware and up through. In this blog I am gonna tell you about android platform And I'm going to talk about some of the key principle that are underlying its design.**\r\n *the whole android architecture is divided into 5 parts given below*\r\n\r\n - Linux Kernel\r\n - Libraries\r\n - Application framework\r\n - Applications\r\n - Android Runtime\r\n\r\nlets take a brief look on each\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n- **Linux Kernel**\r\n------------------\r\n![Linux kernel][1]\r\n\r\nWe use the Linux Kernel as our hardware abstraction. the reason of using linux kernel is it provides lot of cases existing drivers. it also provides  memory management, process management, security model, networking, a lot of core operating system insfrastructure that are robust and have proven over time. \r\n\r\n- **Libraries**\r\n---------------\r\n![Libraries][2]\r\n\r\nthe next level up is native libraries Everything that you see here in green in written in C and at this level where lot of core power of android platform comes from. I am just going to go to through and describe what some of these components are:-\r\n\r\n *1-Surface manager*\r\n\r\nthe surface manager is responsible for different drawing surfaces onto the screen. So it's the surface manager that's resposible  for taking different windows that are owned by different applications that are running in different processes at different times and making sure that the pixels end up on the screen when they are supposed to.\r\n\r\n*2-OpenGL/ES*\r\n\r\nthese two makes the core libraries. OpenGL/ES is a 3D library. We have a software implementation\r\nthat is hardware acceleratable if the device has 3D chip on it. The SGL graphics are for 2D graphics and that is what most of our application drawing based on. One more intresting thing about the android graphics platform is you can combine 3D and 2D graphics in the same application. \r\n\r\n*3-Media Framework*\r\n\r\n The Media Framework was provided by Packet Video, One of the members of the open handset, alliance and that contains all of the codex that make up the core of the media experience. So in there you'll find IMPEG, H.264, MP3, AAC, all audio and video codex you need to build a rich media experience. \r\n\r\n*4-Media Framework*\r\n\r\nWe use Free Type to render our fonts.\r\n\r\n*5- SQLite*\r\n\r\nWe have an implementation of SQLite, We use that as the core of most of our data storage, We have WebKit Which is the open source browser engine, that's what we're using as a core of our browser. It's the same browser that's powering Safari from Apple and we'd made some, We've worked with that engine to make it render well on small screens and on mobile devices Next is the Android Runtime. And the main component small screen mobile devices \r\n\r\n-Android Runtime\r\n---------------\r\n![Android Runtime][3]\r\n*1- Dalvik Virtual Machine*\r\n\r\nThe main Component in android run time is Dalvik Virtual Machine Specially for the Android to meet the needs of running in an embedded environment where you have limited battery, limited memory, limited CPU. The Dalvik Virtual Machine runs something called dex files, D-E-X, And these are bytecodes that are results of converting at build time the .Class and .JAR Files, So these files when they are converted to , dex, become a much more efficient bytecode that can run very well on small Processors. They use memory  very efficiently. The data structure are designed to be shared across processes whenever  possible. And it uses a highly optimized bytecode interpreter. The end result of that is that it's possible to have multiple instances of the Dalvik Virtual Machine running on the device at the same time, One in each of several processes and we'll see why that's important a little bit letter on. \r\n\r\n*2-Core libraries* \r\n\r\nThe next level up from that is the Core libraries. This is in blue meaning that it's written in the java programming language. And the Core library contains all of the collection classes, utilities, IO, all the utilities and tools that you've come to expected to use.\r\n\r\nApplication Framework\r\n---------------------\r\n![Application Framework][4]\r\n Moving up again, we now have the Application Framework. This is all written in java programming laguage and the application framework is the toolkit  that all applications use, These applications include the ones that come with a phone like the home application , or the phone it includes applications written by Google and it includes applications that will be written by you. So, all applications use the same framework and the same APIs. Again, I am going to go through and talk about what some of the main component are in this layer:\r\n\r\n*1-Activity Manager*\r\n\r\nAn Activity Manager is what manages the life Cycle of  applications. it also maintains a common backstack so that applications that are running in different processes can have a smoothly integrated navigation experience.\r\n\r\n*2-Package manager*\r\n\r\nNext down from that is the package manager, The manager is what keeps track of which applications are installed on your device. So, if you download new applications over there or otherwise install applications, it's the package manager that's responsible  for keeping track of what you have and what the capabilities of each of your applications are. The windows manager manages windows. its mostly a java programming languages abstraction on the top of lower level services that are provided by the surface manager. \r\n\r\n*3-Telephony manager*\r\n\r\nThe Telephony manager contains the APIs that we use to build the phone application that's central to the phone experience. \r\n\r\n*4-Content providers*\r\n\r\nContent providers are a unique piece of the android platform That's a framework that allows applications to share their data with other applications.We use that in our contacts application so that all of the information in contacts, phone numbers, address, names is available to any application that wants to make use of them. And other applications can use that facility as well to share data.\r\n\r\n*5-Resource manager*\r\n\r\n The resource manager is what we use to store local strings, bitmaps, layout,file description, all of the external parts of an application that are't code. I'm just going to touch lightly on the remaining\r\n\r\n*6-View system*\r\n\r\nthe view system contains things like buttons and lists, all the building blocks of the UI it also handles things like events dispatching layout, drawing,Location manager, notification manager,  and XMPP service are some APIs that I think will allow developpers to create really innovative and exciting applications.\r\n\r\nApplication\r\n-----------\r\n![Application ][5]\r\nThis is where all the applications get written. It includes the home application, the contacts application, the browser, your applications. And everything at this layer is, again using the same application framework provided by the layers below. Now if you're going to write an application, the first step is to decompose it into the components that are supported by the Android platform, Here are the four major ones. We have activity, intent receiver, service, and content provider.\r\n\r\n*1-Activity* \r\n\r\nAn activity is essentially just a piece of UI typically corresponding to one screen. So if you think something like the mail application, that would be decomposed into maybe three major activities, something that lists your mail, something that shows you what an individual screen to put together an outgoing email.\r\n\r\n*2-Intent Receiver*\r\n\r\n An intent receiver is something different. An intent receiver is a a way for which your application to register some code that won't be running until it's triggered by some external event. And the set of external events that triggers your code is open and extensible. So you can write some code and through XML, Register it to be woken up and run when something happens, when the network, the network activities established or at a certain time or when the phone rings or whatever trigger makes senses for your application.\r\n\r\n*3-Service*\r\n A service is a task that doesn't have any UI, that's long lived, that's running in the background.\r\nA good example is a music player. You may start playing some music from an activity,\r\nfrom a piece of UI, but once the music is playing, you'd want it to keep playing even if you're navigating to other parts of the user experience. So the code that's actually running through the playlist playing songs would be a service, that's running in the background. you can connect to it later if you want to from an activity or some other component by binding to the service and sending and messaging like \"skip to the next\" or \"rewind\". \r\n\r\n*4-content Provider*\r\n\r\nthe last component is a content provider and, again, that's a component that allows you to share some of your data with other processes and other applications. Now, any application can store data in whatever may--way it makes sense for that application. They can store it in the files. They can store it in our super light database, whatever makes sense. But if they want to make that data available as part of the platform so that other applications can make use of it, then the content provider is the solution for that and we have used that  for the context database that comes with the android platform so that any application can make use of the information in context. Android was designed at a fundamental level to encourage reusing and replacing components. I have an example here that shows how that works. On the left, there are four applications that might want to pick a photo for some reason. So the home application might want to pick it for wallpaper. Contacts might want to pick a person's face to associate with their contact card. Gmail or MMS, You might want to have a photo that you sent to someone in an outgoing message. Now, an Android for these applications to make use of the service of  taking a photo, they first need to make a request. So the client component makes a request. So the client component makes a request for a specific action. In this case, I'm illustrating that with a talk ballon and the Gmail application is requesting that it picks a photo. So the talk balloon is actually representation of a formal class in our system called an intent. What the system does when a request is made is it looks at all of the installed components and it finds the best available component that knows how to do whatever was asked for. In this case, Let's say that the system  finds the built in photo gallery. Now, what happens is the Gmail applications is now connected to the photo gallery. When the user in Gmails wanted to pick a photo, he will be taken to the photo gallery and the photo gallery will fulfilled whatever was asked for in the intent\r\nwhat makes it intresting is that the picking of the matching component is late bound, it's done very late and so you can swap software components at any time. So let's say you didn't like the built-in photo gallery and you wanted to replace it with one that went online to find a richer or bigger set of photos. you can replace our built-in photo gallery online to find a richer or bigger set of photos. You can replace our built-in photo gallery with one that say goes out to picasso or whatever your favorite online photo site is. Once you have done that then any of the applications on the left will now use the new and better component on the right to full-fill the task of picking a photo. And at any time, a new application can come along and make use of existing functionality. So if you are writing a blogger application, you dont have to worry about writting a photo picker yourself. you can just rely on that whichever one the user has configured to be their prefered photo picking application. This becomes really important because in Android, it's not just about picking photos virtually any task has an intent in the middle. if the user is going from point A to point B, there's  an intent in the middle and  each of those intents is an opportunity to reuse a component or to replace a component. so we have intents for going home which means you can  replace a home application. or we have an intent for sending an email which means you can replace\r\n\r\n[1]: https://globalforumonline.com/media/technology/Linux_kernel.png\r\n[2]:
